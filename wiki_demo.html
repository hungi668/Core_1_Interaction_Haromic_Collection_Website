    <p>The <b>Goldendoodle</b> is a designer dog created by <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbreed">crossbreeding</a> a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Retriever">Golden Retriever</a> and a Poodle. First widely
        bred in the 1990s, they are bred in three different sizes—each corresponding to the size of Poodle used as a
        parent.</p>
    <p>Goldendoodles often demonstrate Golden Retrievers' intuitive and human-oriented nature in addition to the
        intelligent personality and coat of a Poodle.[1]</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>In the 1990s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_crossbreed" target="blank">designer dog</a> breeders
            in
            Australia and the United States (Ryan Harvey) started to widely cross Golden Retrievers and Poodles,
            adopting
            the term goldendoodle to describe the cross.[2] The name doodle is also used to describe this crossbreed.
            The
            name goldendoodle is derived from "golden" (from Golden Retriever) and "Labradoodle" (itself a portmanteau
            of
            Labrador Retriever and a Poodle).[3][4] Deliberately breeding Poodles with Golden Retrievers actually
            preceded
            the 1990s. An example of this was done by Monica Dickens, the great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens, who
            crossed the two breeds in 1969.[5] The cross can result in a healthier animal than either of the parent
            breeds.
        </p>
        <p>The original aim of the goldendoodle's breeders was to produce an alternative to the popular labradoodle.[3]
            Initially goldendoodles were only bred from standard-sized Poodles, but designer breeders also started using
            small varieties of Poodles to create a smaller crossbreed.[2] As they are a crossbreed, they are not
            recognized
            by the AKC, FCI or British Kennel Clubs. Goldendoodles have been developed beyond the F1 (Golden Retriever
            crossed with a Poodle) and are now available in deeper generations created by crossing two goldendoodles.
            These
            are called multigenerational or multigen goldendoodles.[citation needed]</p>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <h3><b>Appearance</b></h3>
    <p>The appearance, size, and coat of goldendoodles can vary considerably according to their breeding generations and
        what type of Poodle parents they have.[1] While some goldendoodles share common traits, each goldendoodle might
        have its own unique appearance and temperament.[8]</p>
    <p>Illustration detailing goldendoodles' physical appearance. In general, goldendoodles have round skulls, broad
        muzzles, heavily feathered tail, drop ears, and oval-shaped eyes.[2] Goldendoodles' retriever parentage makes
        their body long and muscular, and likely to have a deep chest and wide stance.[1]</p>
    <p>The goldendoodle can be bred from any one of the Standard, Miniature or Toy-sized Poodles, the resultant
        offspring coming in several sizes: the standard, medium and miniature goldendoodles.[2] The standard
        goldendoodle typically stands 20 to 25 inches (51 to 64 cm) and weighs 51 to 80 pounds (23 to 36 kg), the medium
        goldendoodle typically stands 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 cm) and weighs 36 to 50 pounds (16 to 23 kg), and the
        miniature goldendoodle typically stands up to 20 inches (51 cm) and weighs 15 to 35 pounds (6.8 to 15.9 kg)</p>
    <p>The goldendoodle is a long-haired dog breed and their coat can vary considerably, there are three main coat
        types: straight, wavy and curly.[2] Wavy coated goldendoodles are a combination of the Poodle's curly coat and
        the Golden Retriever's straight coat. Their coat is wavy, with loose, shaggy curls. This type of coat is the
        most common amongst goldendoodles. Curly coated goldendoodles resemble the coat of a Poodle. Their coat is thick
        and curly.[2] Goldendoodle coats come in varying colors, with the most common colors being cream, red, black,
        gold, apricot, brown, or a combination (parti-colored).[1]</p>
    <p>Goldendoodles are often claimed to be 'hypoallergenic' or 'non-shedding'.[2] However research has shown that
        hypoallergenicity can not be an official dog breed characteristic.[9] AKC also asserts that "there is no such
        thing as a completely hypoallergenic dog".[10]</p>
    <p>It used to be thought that the higher the percentage of Poodle is in a goldendoodle's heritage, the less likely
        it is to shed.[1] It was also thought that curlier coated goldendoodles tend to shed lighter and produce less
        dander.[2]</p>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <p>In general, goldendoodles tend to take on a Golden Retriever’s friendly, affectionate, trustworthy and
        enthusiastic nature,[1] whilst also demonstrating a Poodle’s reputable intelligence, sociability and
        trainability.[1] Goldendoodles predominantly exhibit high levels of energy, loyalty and playfulness;[1] they are
        often friendly with children and considered a good family pet. This friendliness and loyalty, however, means
        they are prone to separation anxiety, especially as puppies.[1][11] The crossbreed often exhibits strong
        retriever instincts inherited from its gundog parent breeds,[11] which make them have an active mouth and high
        tendency to retrieve objects.[1]</p>
    <p>A 2019 behavioural study compared goldendoodles to their parent breeds and found that, on average, goldendoodles
        displayed significantly lower dog-rivalry than purebred Miniature Poodles, and significantly higher dog-directed
        aggression, dog-directed fear, and stranger-directed fear than purebred Golden Retrievers, Miniature Poodles, or
        Standard Poodles.[6]</p>
    <h2>Health</h2>
    <p>Goldendoodles may avoid inheriting disease or health issues from parents, but may alternatively be susceptible to
        more health issues if the parents are unhealthy to begin with.[7]</p>
    <p>Goldendoodles are prone to megaesophagus.[12]</p>
    <h2>Popularity and Uses</h2>
    <p>Primarily bred as companion dogs, goldendoodles have been successfully trained as therapy dogs, guide dogs,[3]
        nut-detection dogs detecting nuts in food for people with nut allergies,[13] and other forms of assistance
        dogs.[14]</p>
    <p>In some regions of the United States it has become one of the most popular dog varieties.[15][16][17] In
        Australia, it was named one of the top twenty most popular dog varieties in 2020[18] where, due to the increased
        demand for pets during the COVID-19 pandemic, prices for a puppy have risen from around $3,500 AUD before the
        pandemic, to as much as $15,000 AUD by September 2020.[19]</p>
    <p>In a 2012 charity auction, American musician Usher paid US$12,000 for a goldendoodle puppy.[2]</p>
    <p>Despite their growing popularity, goldendoodles remain unrecognized by prominent canine organizations such as the
        American Kennel Club (AKC)[20] or British Kennel Clubs due to their hybrid status.</p>
